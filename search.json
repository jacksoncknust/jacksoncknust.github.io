    "text": "Coaching transitions at blue-blood programs rarely go smoothly. When Mike Krzyzewski stepped away in 2022, Duke faced the same uncertainty that often derails historic programs, but Jon Scheyer has defied that trend.\nInstead of a drop-off, Duke has remained one of college basketball’s most consistent winners. The numbers show why.\n\n\nCode\nduke &lt;- duke |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Season = as.numeric(substr(year, 1, 4)),\n    WinPct = as.numeric(`W.L.`),\n    Coach = recode(Coach,\n                   \"Krzyzewski\" = \"Coach K\",\n                   \"Mike Krzyzewski\" = \"Coach K\",\n                   \"Jon Scheyer\" = \"Jon Scheyer\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(duke, aes(x = Season, y = WinPct, color = Coach, group = Coach)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Coach K\" = \"blue\", \"Jon Scheyer\" = \"black\")) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n           x = 2022.2,\n           y = 0.92,\n           label = \"Coach K retires\",\n           size = 3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2022, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scheyer has kept Duke in the same winning range as Coach K\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite replacing a legend, Duke’s win percentage under Scheyer mirrors late-era Coach K seasons.\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | Graphic by Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheyer has been able to sustain the level of excellence that Coach K had built for so long. He has done this in a few different ways but one of the biggest reasons has been recruiting.\nCoach K was a phenomal recruiter. He was a man that young men and the families of young men trusted with their future. Taking over a legacy of recruiting like that must be extremely difficult right?\n\n\nCode\nduke_long &lt;- duke |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(rec_team_rank, top50_rec),\n    names_to = \"Metric\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Metric = case_when(\n      Metric == \"rec_team_rank\" ~ \"Team Recruiting Ranking\",\n      Metric == \"top50_rec\" ~ \"Top-50 Recruits\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(duke_long, aes(x = year, y = Value, color = Coach)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Metric, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Coach K\" = \"blue\", \"Jon Scheyer\" = \"black\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2), limits = c(0, 10)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scheyer Is Sustaining Duke’s Recruiting Strength\",\n    subtitle = \"Recruiting class rankings (lower = better) and Top-50 recruit totals (higher = better) remain strong under Scheyer.\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: 247 Sports | Graphic by Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best ways to evaluate a team beyond simple wins and losses is with KenPom’s efficiency ratings. Teams with elite offensive and defensive numbers, especially those with a strong overall efficiency margin, are typically in the championship conversation. For Scheyer, the challenge was proving Duke could maintain that standard in the post–Coach K era. This season’s KenPom profile shows that not only did Duke remain nationally relevant, but Scheyer’s team was one of the most balanced in the country. The bubble chart below highlights how Duke stacked up against the rest of college basketball.\n\n\nCode\nkenpom &lt;- kenpom |&gt;\n mutate(Team = str_trim(Team)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    highlight = case_when(\n      Team == \"Duke\" ~ \"Duke\",\n      Team == \"Houston\" ~ \"Houston\",\n      Team == \"Florida\" ~ \"Florida\",\n      Team == \"Auburn\" ~ \"Auburn\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n    ),\n    color = case_when(\n      highlight == \"Duke\" ~ \"blue\",\n      highlight == \"Houston\" ~ \"red\",\n      highlight == \"Florida\" ~ \"orange\",\n      highlight == \"Auburn\" ~ \"navy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"grey80\"\n    )\n  )\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = kenpom,\n    aes(\n      x = ORtg,\n      y = DRtg,\n      size = NetRtg,\n      color = color\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.45\n  ) +\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  scale_size(range = c(10, 5), name = \"Efficiency Margin\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = filter(kenpom, highlight != \"Other\"),\n    aes(\n      x = ORtg,\n      y = DRtg,\n      label = Team\n    ),\n    nudge_x = 4,\n    direction = \"y\",\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 4,\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Duke Stood Out Among 2025’s No. 1 Seeds\",\n    subtitle = \"Higher ORtg = better offense · Lower DRtg = better defense · Bigger bubble = higher efficiency margin\",\n    x = \"Offensive Efficiency (ORtg)\",\n    y = \"Defensive Efficiency (DRtg)\",\n    caption = \"Source: KenPom | Graphic by Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you look at all three graphics together, the picture becomes pretty clear: Jon Scheyer hasn’t just held Duke together, he’s kept the program right where it expects to be. The win-percentage chart shows that the Blue Devils never slipped the way many powerhouse programs do after a legendary coach steps away. The recruiting graphic backs that up, showing Scheyer still brings in elite talent at the same level Duke fans are used to. And the KenPom bubble chart puts a bow on it: this past season, Duke had the kind of balance, strong offense, strong defense, and top-tier efficiency, that you normally see from teams built to make deep tournament runs. For a coach in only his third season, that’s not maintaining the standard. That’s proving he can carry it forward."
