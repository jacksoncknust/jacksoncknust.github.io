    "section": "",
    "text": "Coaching transitions at blue-blood programs rarely go smoothly. When Mike Krzyzewski stepped away in 2022, Duke faced the same uncertainty that often derails historic programs, but Jon Scheyer has defied that trend.\nInstead of a drop-off, Duke has remained one of college basketball’s most consistent winners. The numbers show why.\n\n\nCode\nduke &lt;- duke |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Season = as.numeric(substr(year, 1, 4)),\n    WinPct = as.numeric(`W.L.`),\n    Coach = recode(Coach,\n                   \"Krzyzewski\" = \"Coach K\",\n                   \"Mike Krzyzewski\" = \"Coach K\",\n                   \"Jon Scheyer\" = \"Jon Scheyer\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(duke, aes(x = Season, y = WinPct, color = Coach, group = Coach)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Coach K\" = \"blue\", \"Jon Scheyer\" = \"black\")) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n           x = 2022,\n           y = 1,\n           label = \"Coach K retires\",\n           size = 3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2022, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scheyer has kept Duke in the same winning range as Coach K\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite replacing a legend, Duke’s win percentage under Scheyer mirrors late-era Coach K seasons.\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | Graphic by Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheyer has been able to sustain the level of excellence that Coach K had built for so long. He has done this in a few different ways but one of the biggest reasons has been recruiting.\nCoach K was a phenomal recruiter. He was a man that young men and the families of young men trusted with their future. Taking over a legacy of recruiting like that must be extremely difficult right?\n\n\nCode\nduke_long &lt;- duke |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(rec_team_rank, top50_rec),\n    names_to = \"Metric\",\n    values_to = \"Value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Metric = case_when(\n      Metric == \"rec_team_rank\" ~ \"Team Recruiting Ranking\",\n      Metric == \"top50_rec\" ~ \"Top-50 Recruits\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(duke_long, aes(x = year, y = Value, color = Coach)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Metric, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Coach K\" = \"blue\", \"Jon Scheyer\" = \"black\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2), limits = c(0, 10)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scheyer Is Sustaining Duke’s Recruiting Strength\",\n    subtitle = \"Recruiting class rankings (lower = better) and Top-50 recruit totals (higher = better) remain strong under Scheyer.\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: 247 Sports | Graphic by Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best ways to evaluate a team beyond simple wins and losses is with KenPom’s efficiency ratings. Teams with elite offensive and defensive numbers, especially those with a strong overall efficiency margin, are typically in the championship conversation. For Scheyer, the challenge was proving Duke could maintain that standard in the post–Coach K era. This season’s KenPom profile shows that not only did Duke remain nationally relevant, but Scheyer’s team was one of the most balanced in the country. The bubble chart below highlights how Duke stacked up against the rest of college basketball.\n\n\nCode\nkenpom &lt;- kenpom |&gt;\n mutate(Team = str_trim(Team)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    highlight = case_when(\n      Team == \"Duke\" ~ \"Duke\",\n      Team == \"Houston\" ~ \"Houston\",\n      Team == \"Florida\" ~ \"Florida\",\n      Team == \"Auburn\" ~ \"Auburn\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n    ),\n    color = case_when(\n      highlight == \"Duke\" ~ \"blue\",\n      highlight == \"Houston\" ~ \"red\",\n      highlight == \"Florida\" ~ \"orange\",\n      highlight == \"Auburn\" ~ \"navy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"grey80\"\n    )\n  )\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = kenpom,\n    aes(\n      x = ORtg,\n      y = DRtg,\n      size = NetRtg,\n      color = color\n    ),\n    alpha = 0.45\n  ) +\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  scale_size(range = c(10, 5), name = \"Efficiency Margin\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = filter(kenpom, highlight != \"Other\"),\n    aes(\n      x = ORtg,\n      y = DRtg,\n      label = Team\n    ),\n    nudge_x = 4,\n    direction = \"y\",\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 4,\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Duke Stood Out Among 2025’s No. 1 Seeds\",\n    subtitle = \"Higher ORtg = better offense · Lower DRtg = better defense · Bigger bubble = higher efficiency margin\",\n    x = \"Offensive Efficiency (ORtg)\",\n    y = \"Defensive Efficiency (DRtg)\",\n    caption = \"Source: KenPom | Graphic by Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you look at all three graphics together, the picture becomes pretty clear: Jon Scheyer hasn’t just held Duke together, he’s kept the program right where it expects to be. The win-percentage chart shows that the Blue Devils never slipped the way many powerhouse programs do after a legendary coach steps away. The recruiting graphic backs that up, showing Scheyer still brings in elite talent at the same level Duke fans are used to. And the KenPom bubble chart puts a bow on it: this past season, Duke had the kind of balance, strong offense, strong defense, and top-tier efficiency, that you normally see from teams built to make deep tournament runs. For a coach in only his third season, that’s not maintaining the standard. That’s proving he can carry it forward."

    "title": "Dolph Ziggler, The Most Underrated WWE Talent Of All Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For more than a decade, Dolph Ziggler built a reputation as one of WWE’s most reliable in ring performers. Night after night, he delivered high energy matches, made opponents look like stars, and consistently earned strong fan reactions. Fans and critics alike have labeled him as underrated for years. While others cycled through main event pushes, Ziggler was often praised for his performance but left outside the very top of the card.\nThis data story examines whether that long held belief is supported by the numbers. By comparing match ratings with championship opportunities, this project looks at whether Dolph Ziggler’s performance truly matched the level of opportunity he received. The goal is simple: to see if the data confirms what fans have said for years.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(wrestling_clean, aes(\n  x = Wrestler,\n  y = Avg_Match_Rating,\n  color = Wrestler\n)) +\n \n  geom_jitter(\n    width = 0.15,\n    height = 0,\n    size = 2.8\n  ) +\n  \n \n  stat_summary(\n  fun = mean,\n  geom = \"point\",\n  size = 4,\n  shape = 18,\n  color = \"black\",\n  stroke = 1.5\n) +\n  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Dolph Ziggler\" = \"magenta\",\n    \"Roman Reigns\" = \"blue\",\n    \"Sheamus\" = \"green\",\n    \"The Miz\" = \"red\",\n    \"Alberto Del Rio\" = \"gold\"\n  )) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Ziggler Belongs in the Conversation\",\n    subtitle = \"Each dot is a season. Diamonds mark the average match rating for each wrestler.\",\n    x = \"Wrestler\",\n    y = \"Average Match Rating\",\n    color = \"Wrestler\",\n    caption = \"Source: cagematch.net\\nBy Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beeswarm shows that Dolph Ziggler was not just good in short bursts. His ratings stay consistently high across multiple seasons, placing him right at the top of this group in overall performance. While other wrestlers have years that swing more dramatically up and down, Ziggler’s results remain steady. This confirms what fans have long believed through eye test alone. Ziggler was one of the most dependable in-ring workers of his era, capable of delivering quality matches regardless of opponent or position on the card.\nBut strong performance does not always guarantee strong opportunity in WWE. Being great inside the ring is only one part of how pushes are decided. The next graphic shifts the focus away from performance and toward how often these wrestlers were actually trusted with championship opportunities. From here, the story moves from how good Ziggler was to how he was ultimately used.\n\n\nCode\nopportunities_long &lt;- wrestling_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(Wrestler) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Minor = sum(Minor_Title_Matches),\n    Major = sum(Major_Title_Matches),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(Minor, Major),\n    names_to = \"Title_Level\",\n    values_to = \"Matches\"\n  )\n\nggplot(opportunities_long, aes(\n  x = Matches,\n  y = reorder(Wrestler, Matches),\n  fill = Title_Level\n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Minor\" = \"grey70\",\n    \"Major\" = \"black\"\n  )) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Ziggler’s Opportunities Are Mostly in the Mid Card\",\n    subtitle = \"Total minor and major title matches by wrestler\",\n    x = \"Total Title Matches\",\n    y = \"Wrestler\",\n    fill = \"Title Level\",\n    caption = \"Source: cagematch.net\\nBy Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this chart, it becomes clear how uneven Dolph Ziggler’s career really was. He did get a lot of title opportunities overall, but most of them stayed at the minor title level. That tells us WWE trusted him to work often and to keep the mid card entertaining. He was reliable, consistent, and always ready to step into a big moment when needed. At the same time, Roman Reigns’ bar tells a completely different story. Most of his opportunities came at the major title level, showing just how firmly WWE positioned him as the centerpiece of the company. The Miz and Sheamus fall somewhere in the middle, getting chances at both levels but not as extremely split as Ziggler or Roman.\nThis graphic really shows the crossroads of Ziggler’s career. He was never ignored, but he was rarely fully elevated either. He lived in that space where he was important enough to feature, but not important enough to build the company around. From here, the story turns more specific. The next two graphs zoom in on how Ziggler performed within each level of opportunity, starting with the minor title scene where he spent most of his career.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(\n  wrestling_clean,\n  aes(\n    x = Minor_Title_Matches,\n    y = Avg_Match_Rating,\n    color = Wrestler\n  )\n) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    width = 0.25,\n    height = 0,\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Dolph Ziggler\" = \"magenta\",\n    \"Roman Reigns\" = \"blue\",\n    \"Sheamus\" = \"green\",\n    \"The Miz\" = \"red\",\n    \"Alberto Del Rio\" = \"gold\"\n  )) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ziggler Thrives in the Mid Card but Rarely Escapes It\",\n    subtitle = \"Each point represents a season comparing minor title opportunities to match quality\",\n    x = \"Minor Title Matches in a Year\",\n    y = \"Average Match Rating\",\n    color = \"Wrestler\",\n    caption = \"Source: cagematch.net\\nBy Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graphic shows exactly where Dolph Ziggler spent the bulk of his career. Even as his match ratings stay near the top of the group, his minor title opportunities remain consistently high. That tells us WWE trusted him to be the backbone of the mid card. He was the one who could be relied on to make championships feel important, to elevate opponents, and to keep fans engaged night after night. However, what stands out is how rarely that success led to a true step up. Other wrestlers move in and out of this space, but Ziggler stays planted in it. The data shows he did everything right in this role, yet that performance did not open the door to anything more permanent at the top.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(wrestling_clean, aes(\n  x = Major_Title_Matches,\n  y = Avg_Match_Rating,\n  color = Wrestler\n)) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    width = 0.25,\n    height = 0,\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Dolph Ziggler\" = \"magenta\",\n    \"Roman Reigns\" = \"blue\",\n    \"Sheamus\" = \"green\",\n    \"The Miz\" = \"red\",\n    \"Alberto Del Rio\" = \"gold\"\n  )) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Major Title Opportunities Do Not Always Follow Performance\",\n    subtitle = \"Each point represents a season comparing major title opportunities to match quality\",\n    x = \"Major Title Matches in a Year\",\n    y = \"Average Match Rating\",\n    color = \"Wrestler\",\n    caption = \"Source: cagematch.net\\nBy Jackson Knust\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the focus shifts to major title opportunities, the gap becomes impossible to ignore. Even in seasons where Ziggler’s match ratings matched or exceeded those of his peers, he rarely appears in the major title picture. Roman Reigns, by contrast, dominates this space regardless of fluctuations in performance, showing how clearly WWE committed to him as the face of the company. The Miz and Alberto Del Rio appear more often than Ziggler, even with less consistent in ring results. This final graphic brings the entire argument together. Ziggler proved again and again that he belonged at the highest level, but sustained main event opportunity never followed his production.\nIn the end, the numbers line up with what many fans have been saying for years. Dolph Ziggler was one of the most consistent and reliable performers of his era, with match ratings that put him right alongside or even ahead of some of WWE’s biggest names. He showed up, delivered, and made others look better every time he stepped in the ring. What the data also shows is that this level of performance did not translate into the same kind of sustained main event opportunity that others received. Ziggler was trusted to work often, but rarely trusted to carry the very top of the card for long.\nThat gap between what he did in the ring and how often he was truly given the ball is what makes him feel so underrated. This project does not say that Roman Reigns, The Miz, or anyone else did not deserve their chances. Instead, it shows that Ziggler had a strong case to be in that conversation more than he was. When you look at performance and opportunity side by side, it is hard to argue that he got everything his work might have earned. If anything, the data only strengthens the idea that Dolph Ziggler was one of the most underused and under rewarded talents WWE has ever had."
